# Introduction_To_Data_Structures_In_Java

# Coding challenge in Java; IT 179-ISU.

# Course Description : 
* This course will build upon your introductory programming and design skills from 168.   
* You will learn new programming concepts, such as recursion, expand your understanding of object-oriented design.
* You will be introduced to new tools for programming such as several elementary data structures: linked lists, stacks, 
  queues, and binary trees.  We will also continue to hone your testing and debugging skills. 
* Programs are both larger and more complex, growing as your skills are growing.

# Objectives:
  * Upon completion of IT 179 you should be able to
  1.	Develop moderately complex computer programs.
  2.	Employ appropriate object-oriented program design and documentation methods including the design of appropriate OO classes and methods.
  3.	Implement and use elementary data structures such as linked lists, stacks, queues, and binary trees correctly.
  4.	Design test data and conduct varying levels of program testing.
  5.	Trace and write simple recursive methods.
