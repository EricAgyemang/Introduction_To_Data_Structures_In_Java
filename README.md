# Introduction_To_Data_Structures_In_Java

# Coding challenge

# Course Description : 
  * This course helps readers to build upon their introductory programming and design skills. 
  * You will learn new programming concepts, such as recursion,Algorithm efficiency and expand your understanding of Object-Oriented design.
  * You will be introduced to new tools for programming such as several data structures: linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, sets, and 
    disjoint sets. 
  * It  futher continue to hone your testing and debugging skills. Programs are done both larger and more complex, growing as your skills are growing.

# Objectives:
  * Upon completion of the course you should be able to:
    1. Develop moderately complex computer programs.
    2. Employ appropriate object-oriented program design and documentation methods including the design of appropriate Object-Oriented
       classes and methods.
    3. Implement and use elementary data structures such as linked lists, stacks, queues, and binary trees correctly.
    4. Design test data and conduct varying levels of program testing.
    5. Trace and write simple recursive methods.
